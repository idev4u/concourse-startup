# ðŸš€ Concourse Startup

### Why?
Because [Concourse Ci](https://concourse.ci) is one of the best CI/CD Tools that I ever used and I though it could be nice to share this project, if somebody will play with Concourse. I have to be honest, I tested it only on the mac. But if somebody would run it on linux or windows, I'm open for pull requests.

### Requirements

Installed [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/)

### How to

```
bash$ git clone https://github.com/idev4u/concourse-startup.git
bash$ cd concourse-startup
bash$ ./startup.sh
```

example output
```

==> INFO: âš™ Yes! It's already there.
==> INFO: âš™ Ups, there is something strange! Concourse is not up!
==> INFO: âš™ checking if concourse is already running

```

## Pipeline

### Overview

The pipeline will triggert from a 2 minutes timer.
